# CrimsonWeb
Work in progress crime fighting software. Features data of over 200,000 crimes from the Atlanta area. 
This was featured in a talk at PhreakNIC 19, a hacker conference in Nashville, TN.

Made to help local superhero, the Crimson Fist.

Crimson used to go through crime data line by line, copying each part into an excel spreadsheet until
he met Nathan Burnham at Freeside Atlanta.

Nathan did the backend, Jonathan Popham did (and is still doing) the front end.

Crimson had the idea and routinely puts his life on the line.

The app uses polymer, firebase, and core javascript.
There is also a corresponding android app called CrimsonFist.
